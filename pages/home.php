	<p>The past decade produced a rich ecosystem of web sites that provide
	personalized access to (semi-)structured data: financial asset
	tracking and management sites, personalized news delivery services,
	and even customized web search engines are all but a few examples. A
	second wave of innovation has been fueled by the explosive growth of
	web platforms that enable rich online social interactions, such as
	online social networks, web communities, wikis, and mashups. These new
	applications go beyond personalized information access and
	dissemination. Users can now transcend their role of passive content
	consumers and engage in content creation, sharing, and various forms
	of online collaboration as well. This online collaboration has
	recently moved to the next level through crowdsourcing: applications
	that enable users to help other users in completing their tasks.</p>

	<p>All aforementioned applications rely critically on user-centric data —
	such as profile data, preferences, activity logs, location, group
	memberships, and social connections — to provide a personalized
	experience, including personalized search results, personalized ads,
	product recommendations, coupons and so forth. Additionally, online
	social applications provide an unprecedented amount of
	user-contributed social and context data. The interconnected nature of
	personalized, social, and contextual data management problems as well
	as the fertile research ground these represent motivate a discussion
	on these problems within the database community. We need to obtain a
	common understanding of new challenges and to collaborate on the
	design of new models, algorithms, and systems for emerging
	applications. The PersDB 2013 workshop aims at providing the
	appropriate venue for discussion and debate of the relevant issues and
	at nurturing related future research and applications.</p>
