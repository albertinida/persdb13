	<h3>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h3>

	<p>This workshop's objective is to create a forum where novel, visionary, or even groundbreaking ideas will be presented, discussed, and debated. To this direction, we encourage authors to submit vision, system, original research, practical experience or position papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Papers submitted should be at most six (6) pages long. Papers should be submitted electronically as PDF files and be formatted using the VLDB format. Detailed formatting instructions and samples are available here:</p>
